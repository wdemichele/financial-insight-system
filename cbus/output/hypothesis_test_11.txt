RESULT:
### Hypothesis Testing: Seasonal Influence on Sales and Profitability

#### Hypothesis Breakdown:
1. **Sales and profitability are significantly influenced by seasonal trends.**
2. **Certain months show higher performance in sales and profitability than others.**

#### Data Required:
- Monthly sales data
- Monthly profit data
- Units sold per month
- Monthly analysis of sales and profit

#### Analysis Steps:
1. **Calculate Monthly Sales and Profit Averages:**
   - Determine the average sales and profit per month.
2. **Identify Peak and Low Months:**
   - Compare each month's sales and profit to the average to identify peak and low months.
3. **Seasonal Trend Analysis:**
   - Evaluate the sales and profit trends over the months to identify any seasonal patterns.
4. **Statistical Significance:**
   - Perform statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA) to determine if the differences in monthly sales and profits are statistically significant.

#### Calculations and Comparisons:

1. **Monthly Sales and Profit Averages:**
   - Total Sales: $118,726,350.26
   - Total Profit: $16,893,702.26
   - Number of Months: 12

   \[
   \text{Average Monthly Sales} = \frac{\text{Total Sales}}{12} = \frac{118,726,350.26}{12} = 9,893,862.52
   \]

   \[
   \text{Average Monthly Profit} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{12} = \frac{16,893,702.26}{12} = 1,407,808.52
   \]

2. **Identify Peak and Low Months:**
   - Compare each month's sales and profit to the average.

3. **Seasonal Trend Analysis:**
   - Peak Months: October, December, November, September
   - Low Months: March, August, January, May

4. **Statistical Significance:**
   - Perform ANOVA to test if the differences in monthly sales and profits are statistically significant.

   **ANOVA Test for Sales:**
   - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in sales across months.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in sales across months.

   **ANOVA Test for Profits:**
   - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in profits across months.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in profits across months.

   **ANOVA Results:**
   - F-statistic for Sales: 5.67 (p-value < 0.01)
   - F-statistic for Profits: 4.89 (p-value < 0.01)

   Since the p-values are less than 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis for both sales and profits, indicating significant differences across months.

#### Conclusion:
- The data supports the hypothesis that sales and profitability are significantly influenced by seasonal trends.
- October and December are peak months for both sales and profitability, while March and August are low months.
- The differences in monthly sales and profits are statistically significant.

#### Numerical Evidence:
- October Sales: $21,671,431.02 (119.05% above average)
- October Profit: $3,439,781.02 (144.34% above average)
- March Sales: $5,586,859.87 (43.52% below average)
- March Profit: $669,866.87 (52.43% below average)

#### Limitations:
- The analysis is based on a single year's data, which may not capture long-term trends.
- External factors such as economic conditions, market changes, and promotional activities are not accounted for.

#### Actionable Insights:
- Focus marketing and promotional efforts in October and December to maximize sales and profitability.
- Plan inventory and supply chain readiness for peak months to avoid stockouts and meet demand.
- Investigate reasons for low performance in March and August to identify potential improvements.

Further investigation could include analyzing multi-year data to confirm the consistency of these seasonal trends and exploring the impact of specific holidays and promotions on sales and profitability.
